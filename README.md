**Agent control systems · State-driven decision making · Production-grade AI architecture**

I focus on designing and building **long-running AI agent systems** that operate
reliably in real-world environments.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- agent architecture
- decision & control systems
- production engineering
  
## What I care about

- **State over events**  
  Decisions should be made based on system state, not isolated events.

- **Control before intelligence**  
  Intelligence without control leads to unpredictable systems.

- **Architecture before optimization**  
  A stable architecture matters more than short-term performance gains.

- **Production as a first-class constraint**  
  If it cannot run, be governed, or be audited in production, it is incomplete.

## What I build

I work on agent systems that typically include:

- state and context modeling
- decision orchestration
- proactive and reactive behavior coordination
- tool and action execution boundaries
- observability and governance foundations

These systems are designed to evolve over time, rather than solve single requests.

## Research × Engineering

I believe meaningful agent systems emerge when:

- research ideas are constrained by real engineering trade-offs
- engineering systems are guided by clear decision models

Most of my work explores how abstract decision concepts
can be shaped into systems that survive real-world complexity.

## Current focus

- state-driven agent decision models
- proactive behavior control
- system-level boundaries for AI autonomy
- architecture patterns for long-lived agents

---

I prefer building systems that are understandable, controllable,
and still intelligent enough to be useful.

Sometimes that means doing less — but doing it deliberately.
